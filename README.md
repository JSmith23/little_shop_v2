# Little Shop

Welcome to our e-commerce web application! Using this app visitors can look through an item catalog, add items to their cart, create an account and order items. Registered users can then log in and log out. Merchants can register for our app and sell their items, view all orders associated with their items and order items for themselves as well. Admins have access to the entire app, except for sensitive user information.
